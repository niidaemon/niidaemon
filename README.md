<p style="padding-top: 16px;">
I am passionate about building, learning, and experimenting with code. My interests span across software development, problem-solving, and exploring tools that make engineering more efficient. I enjoy working on solutions that make a difference in the lives of people. I am always curious, open to new technologies and using GitHub to share projects, document my learning journey, and collaborate.
